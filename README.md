# FLSA-Dialouge-Act-Classifier
In this project, we address the problem of dialogue act classification. More specifically, we apply the Feature Latent Semantic Analysis technique to the feature space representing our annotated corpus, causing the feature space to become compact and reduced in size. Next, we train traditional classifiers on the reduced feature space. Finally, with the idea that a reduced dimensional space will lead to reduced sparsity and noise in the data, we conduct multiple experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique. Although applying the FLSA technique leads to slightly lower performance, we find interesting insights when comparing the FLSA technique and the traditional classification setting.
